# NLPExample

## Overview

**NLPExample** is a C++ project that demonstrates a simple Natural Language Processing (NLP) application. This project includes a basic implementation for tokenization, word frequency analysis, and part-of-speech tagging. The goal is to provide a foundational example of how to handle and analyze text data using C++.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Split a sentence into individual words or tokens.
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Count the occurrences of each word in the provided text.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Basic tagging to identify parts of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs).

## Project Structure

- `src/`
  - `NLPExample/`
    - `Core/`
      - `Application.h`: Defines the `Application` class that handles the core functionality of the NLP application.
      - `Application.cpp`: Implements the methods of the `Application` class.
    - `EntryPoint/`
      - `EntryPoint.h`: Defines the `EntryPoint` class, including the entry point for the application.
      - `EntryPoint.cpp`: Implements the methods of the `EntryPoint` class.
    - `NLP/`
      - `NLP.h`: Defines the `NLP` class with methods for tokenization, frequency analysis, and tagging.
      - `NLP.cpp`: Implements the methods of the `NLP` class.
  - `main.cpp`: The main entry point for the application.

## Installation

To compile and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NorthernL1ghts/NLPExample.git
    cd NLPExample
    ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang). You can use a build system like CMake for managing the build process. If using CMake:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:

    After building, you can run the application:

    ```bash
    ./NLPExample
    ```

## Usage

To use the NLP functionalities, modify the `main.cpp` file to include text input and call the relevant methods from the `Application` class. For example:

```cpp
#include "Application.h"

int main() {
    NLPExample::Application app;
    app.run(); // Your application logic here
    return 0;
}
```
